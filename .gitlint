[title-match-regex]
# python like regex (https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html) that the
# commit-msg title must be matched to.
# Note that the regex can contradict with other rules if not used correctly
# (e.g. title-must-not-contain-word).
#regex=^US[0-9]*

[title-must-not-contain-word]
# Comma-separated list of words that should not occur in the title. Matching is case
# insensitive. It's fine if the keyword occurs as part of a larger word (so "WIPING"
# will not cause a violation, but "WIP: my title" will.
